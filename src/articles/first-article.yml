  Hi, I'm Jim DeSelms. I'm building a personal website to share some thoughts and projects.

  Rather than using a CMS, I'm writing this from scratch. For now, it's a React app where all of the articles are defined
  in YAML files, with fields in Markdown.

  There are more efficient ways to do this, but I also find that the best way to learn how things is to basically build
  them myself.

  Anyhow, I've always been really interested in language and compiler design, and I have a compiler idea I've been kicking
  around for a few years, and I'd like to try to bring it to life in this project.

  I'm sure I'll have other stuff I include in here.
